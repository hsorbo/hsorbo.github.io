## About

I'm an apple OS X user and CLUE doesn't run on OS X, that was my motivation for writing this program. I'm not going to release the source code for this. This is because releasing the decompression/decryption algorithm would in effect expose all intellectual property of CLUE. You could just dump the content of the dictionaries to text files and I'm not sure that is fair. All work on iClue this is done by me, personally. Comments goes here: havard@hsorbo.no (Please don't ask for the source or dictionaries. Questions regarding source-code will find it's way into the trash. Dictionaries can be bought at clue
